## List of projects that I learned from ZTM JS-20-Projects course, to be used as references for future project

#### This is a list of 20 projects that I learned from the ZTM JS-20-Projects course, which I can use as references for future projects. Each project was built using pure JavaScript, HTML5, and CSS3, and taught me best practices for building responsive and mobile-first web applications.

#### Throughout the course, I learned how to work with various Web APIs such as localStorage, DOM, and more, as well as how to use modern CSS3 and HTML5 features like Animations, Transitions, Canvas, Video, and Audio.

Here is a list of the projects, along with the technologies and APIs used:
**Quote Generator** - _Fetch, Async/Await, Quote API, CORS_<br>
<em>Generate inspirational quotes with this web app, which uses the Fetch API to retrieve quotes from an external Quote API. Async/Await is used to handle asynchronous programming, and CORS is used to allow cross-origin resource sharing.
